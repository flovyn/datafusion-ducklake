//! DuckLake `DELETE` execution plan.
//!
//! Backs [`crate::table::DuckLakeTable`]'s `TableProvider::delete_from`. When
//! executed, it performs the delete and yields a single `count: UInt64` row
//! (rows affected), mirroring the count contract of
//! [`DuckLakeInsertExec`](crate::insert_exec::DuckLakeInsertExec).
//!
//! Two paths:
//! - **Filtered delete** (a `WHERE` clause): for each live data file, resolve the
//!   physical row positions matching the predicate, union them with the file's
//!   already-deleted positions, write ONE cumulative positional delete file, and
//!   commit every affected file's delete file in a SINGLE snapshot (atomic
//!   multi-file delete). The read path is already delete-aware, so a subsequent
//!   `SELECT` excludes the deleted rows automatically.
//! - **Delete-all** (no `WHERE`): a metadata-only truncate — end every live data
//!   file in one new snapshot. Much cheaper than positional-deleting every row.
//!
//! v1 handles insert-only data files. Files rewritten by an UPDATE/compaction
//! (an embedded row-id column) cannot be resolved by physical position, so the
//! filtered path cleanly errors on them rather than risk mis-deleting.
//!
//! # Session lifecycle (important)
//!
//! A [`DuckLakeCatalog`](crate::DuckLakeCatalog) pins its snapshot at creation
//! and never refreshes it, so a `SessionContext` observes ONE catalog generation
//! for its whole lifetime. A `DELETE` commits a new snapshot, but the same
//! session keeps reading the old one. Consequences:
//!
//! - A second filtered `DELETE` in the same session that re-touches a data file
//!   modified by an earlier `DELETE` (in that same session) aborts with a
//!   [`Conflict`](crate::DuckLakeError::Conflict): it resolves against the pinned
//!   (pre-delete) view, so its compare-and-swap disagrees with the live catalog.
//!   This is the SAME guard that (correctly) rejects a genuinely concurrent
//!   writer — and it is what prevents a stale, non-cumulative delete file from
//!   resurrecting already-deleted rows.
//! - A `SELECT` after a `DELETE` (or `INSERT`) in the same session returns the
//!   pre-mutation rows; a just-inserted row cannot be deleted in the same
//!   session (it is invisible to the pinned snapshot).
//!
//! To perform multiple mutations, re-open the catalog (or create a fresh
//! `SessionContext`) between statements so it binds to the latest snapshot.
