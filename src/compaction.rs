//! Explicit, triggered DuckLake compaction for a single table.
//!
//! Two maintenance operations, each invoked programmatically (never
//! automatically on write) and returning a [`CompactionResult`] with metrics:
//!
//! 1. [`DuckLakeTable::merge_adjacent_files`] coalesces several small data files
//!    of one table (of the SAME schema version — never across a DDL boundary)
//!    into fewer larger ones. A merged file that spans more than one origin
//!    snapshot is written as a DuckLake **partial data file**: it embeds each
//!    row's original rowid AND a per-row `_ducklake_internal_snapshot_id` column,
//!    and its catalog row records `partial_max` (the maximum origin snapshot id
//!    among its rows), so time travel / change feeds can still attribute every
//!    merged row to its origin snapshot.
//! 2. [`DuckLakeTable::rewrite_data_files`] rewrites a data file whose deleted
//!    fraction exceeds a threshold (DuckDB's default is 0.95): it reads only the
//!    file's LIVE rows (delete-aware), writes them to a new file preserving each
//!    row's rowid, and retires BOTH the old data file and its delete file.
//!
//! Both operations commit ATOMICALLY in one snapshot via
//! `MetadataWriter::commit_compaction`: the rewritten outputs are registered, the
//! source files (and, for a rewrite, their delete files) are retired
//! (`end_snapshot` set) and scheduled for physical deletion, and
//! `ducklake_snapshot_changes.changes_made` records `compacted_table:<table_id>`.
//! Compaction changes the physical layout, not the logical rows, so the commit is
//! structured NOT to conflict with a concurrent append; it aborts only if a
//! source file was retired, or its live rows changed, since it was read (the
//! `base_snapshot` conflict check), which prevents ever resurrecting a
//! retired/deleted row into an output.
//!
//! Retired files are only SCHEDULED for deletion, never removed here, so time
//! travel to a pre-compaction snapshot still reads them until
//! [`cleanup_old_files_sqlite`](crate::maintenance::cleanup_old_files_sqlite)
//! reclaims them.
