# Compatibility & Feature Matrix

This is the authoritative reference for what `datafusion-ducklake` supports: catalog
backends, object stores, types, capabilities, and current limitations. The
[README](README.md) covers getting started; this file covers "does it support X?".

> Status: alpha. APIs and supported surface change as DataFusion and the DuckLake
> spec evolve. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what shipped when.

## Catalog backends

DuckLake stores catalog metadata in a SQL database. Reads are supported on all four
backends below; writes (`INSERT`, `DROP TABLE`, maintenance) are currently implemented
for SQLite and PostgreSQL only. SQL `CREATE TABLE`/CTAS works on the SQLite
single-catalog path; the PostgreSQL path is the experimental multi-catalog layout (see
below) where tables are created via `DuckLakeTableWriter` and then appended to with
`INSERT INTO`.

| Backend    | Read | Write | Multi-catalog | Feature flags                                          |
|------------|:----:|:-----:|:-------------:|--------------------------------------------------------|
| DuckDB     |  ✅  |  ❌   |      ❌       | `metadata-duckdb` (default)                            |
| SQLite     |  ✅  |  ✅   |      ❌       | `metadata-sqlite`, `write-sqlite`                      |
| PostgreSQL |  ✅  |  ✅   |      ✅       | `metadata-postgres`, `write-postgres`, `multicatalog-postgres` |
| MySQL      |  ✅  |  ❌   |      ❌       | `metadata-mysql`                                       |

**Multi-catalog** (PostgreSQL only, **experimental**) lets a single metadata store hold
multiple independent DuckLake catalogs. Reading multiple catalogs requires
`multicatalog-postgres` (`MulticatalogProvider`); creating/managing them requires
`write-postgres` (`MulticatalogManager`).

> ⚠️ The multi-catalog layout is **specific to this library** — it is not part of the
> DuckLake specification and is not (yet) supported or accepted upstream. Catalogs
> written this way are only readable through `MulticatalogProvider`, not as standard
> single-catalog DuckLake stores. PostgreSQL writes currently go through this path, so
> **all PostgreSQL write support should be treated as experimental** and subject to
> change. Note also that SQL `CREATE TABLE`/CTAS is not available on this path (the first
> write of a table goes through `DuckLakeTableWriter`); `INSERT INTO` works once a table
> exists.

For dynamic linking against a system `libduckdb`, disable defaults and re-enable just
the read backend: `--no-default-features --features metadata-duckdb` (requires
`libduckdb` installed; set `DUCKDB_LIB_DIR` and `DUCKDB_INCLUDE_DIR`).

Maintenance and `DROP TABLE` are driven through the Rust API (`maintenance` module and
`MetadataWriter`), not SQL DDL.

## Write concurrency

Both write backends use the same **commit-time** model: a write's snapshot id, all its
metadata rows, and its publication are written in **one transaction**, with the snapshot id
assigned at commit (so per-catalog id order == commit order) and nothing visible until that
transaction commits. There are no "dormant" (committed-but-unpublished) rows, so reads never
observe another writer's uncommitted schema, a transient empty table, or a torn generation.
On Postgres multi-catalog the begin step only *reserves* ids (via the IDENTITY sequence) and
reads existing state; it writes nothing.

`WriteMode::Replace` (SQL `INSERT OVERWRITE`, and the first write of a table) is
**abort-on-conflict** under concurrency, matching DuckLake's snapshot isolation:

- **Two concurrent `Replace`s of the same table never silently union.** The first to
  commit wins; the later one — whose base is now stale — aborts with
  `DuckLakeError::Conflict` (retryable by the caller). The check runs at the commit point
  under the catalog lock: a `Replace` aborts if any data file **or** column of the table has
  `begin_snapshot`/`end_snapshot` newer than the catalog head it began on.
- **Column ids are stable** across writes: an unchanged column keeps its `column_id`
  (== parquet field-id); a same-schema `Replace` rewrites no column rows. Only added/removed
  columns are written.

Known edges:

- **`Append` (`INSERT INTO`) is not conflict-checked.** Concurrent appends commute and are
  both retained (matching DuckLake); a *stale* `Append` issued before a concurrent `Replace`
  is not detected. Use `Replace` for overwrite semantics.
- A **fileless same-schema `Replace`** (an empty-table overwrite that writes no data file and
  changes no column) leaves no per-table footprint, so it resolves **last-writer-wins** rather
  than abort-on-conflict (both backends). Data-bearing and schema-changing replaces are
  conflict-checked.
- A **column type change is rejected on a data write** (`Replace` **and** `Append`) — this is
  a **behavior change**: previously a type change on `Replace` was silently dropped (the column
  kept its old type, corrupting reads); it is now a clear error. Schema evolution goes through
  the explicit, widening-only **`promote_column_type`** (it retires the old column version and
  inserts a new one with the **same field-id**, mirroring upstream DuckLake's `ALTER`-vs-`INSERT`
  separation; reads cast old narrow files up to the widened type). A widening refresh should call
  `promote_column_type`, then write under the new type. Add/remove columns on `Replace` still work.
- **Schema evolution is versioned.** A promote leaves two `ducklake_column` rows sharing one
  `column_id` (old retired via `end_snapshot`, new live), matching upstream. On the
  **PostgreSQL multicatalog** layout this is enforced by a composite PK + a partial unique
  index; on the **SQLite single-catalog** layout `ducklake_column` matches upstream's bare
  shape (no PK) and the one-live-version invariant is enforced in the writer + tests. Catalogs
  created by an earlier version are migrated in place on open (idempotent, lossless).
- **`schema_version` is maintained on both write layouts.** SQLite and PostgreSQL both carry
  `schema_version` on `ducklake_snapshot` and a `ducklake_schema_versions` ledger table, bumped
  on a schema change (table create, column add/remove/reorder, type promotion) and carried
  forward on a pure data write — matching upstream's `if (SchemaChangesMade()) schema_version++`.
  Both deliberately omit upstream's `next_catalog_id` / `next_file_id` snapshot columns (this
  library allocates ids from its own counters, never from the snapshot row). Because of that
  omission a SQLite catalog is DuckLake-*design*-faithful but **not yet a drop-in DuckDB
  catalog** — DuckDB's writer expects those allocator columns. Full DuckDB write-compat is a
  tracked follow-up.
- A single `Replace` is assumed to register **one** data file (the current writer path); the
  conflict check is not designed for multiple `register_data_file` calls sharing one base.
- Two concurrent `CREATE TABLE` of the same name on the PostgreSQL multi-catalog path are
  rejected by a unique index, surfacing as a raw database unique-violation rather than a
  clean `Conflict`. A `DROP` racing a write can likewise surface as a raw unique-violation.

## Limitations

- **Write backends:** DuckDB and MySQL are read-only; writes require SQLite or PostgreSQL.
- **No SQL-level time travel:** a catalog is bound to a single snapshot. You *can* select
  the snapshot programmatically — `DuckLakeCatalog::with_snapshot(provider, snapshot_id)`
  binds to a specific one, and querying another point in time means creating another
  catalog. What's missing is SQL-level historical querying (`AS OF`) within one handle.
- **One mutation per session, then re-open the catalog.** Because a catalog pins its
  snapshot at creation and never refreshes, a `SessionContext` observes a single generation
  for its lifetime. After a `DELETE` (or `INSERT`) commits, the same session keeps reading
  the pre-mutation state; a `SELECT` won't see the change, a just-inserted row can't be
  deleted, and a **second `DELETE` re-touching a file the first modified aborts with a
  conflict** (the compare-and-swap that also guards genuine concurrency — it is what prevents
  a stale delete file from resurrecting deleted rows). Re-open the catalog (or create a fresh
  `SessionContext`) between mutating statements so it binds to the latest snapshot.
- **No partition-based file pruning** on read.
- **Complex / nested types** have minimal support.
- **DuckDB-encrypted (non-PME) Parquet files** are not supported (only PME).
- **Data inlining is not read.** DuckDB's ducklake extension inlines small INSERTs
  (≤ `ducklake_default_data_inlining_row_limit`, default 10 rows) into the catalog
  rather than Parquet files. This crate only reads `ducklake_data_file` rows, so inlined
  data is invisible — `SELECT COUNT(*)` will silently undercount. If you write through
  DuckDB and read through this crate, either disable inlining at write time
  (`SET ducklake_default_data_inlining_row_limit = 0` on every writer connection) or run
  `COMPACT` before reading. Catalogs written entirely through this crate's
  `SqliteMetadataWriter` are unaffected — we never inline.
