## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Column type promotion (`MetadataWriter::promote_column_type`).** Explicit, widening-only schema evolution (e.g. `int32 → int64`): it retires the live `ducklake_column` row and inserts a new version with the **same** `column_id` (stable Parquet field-id), so files written before and after both resolve correctly and old narrow values are cast up on read — no data rewrite. Allowed widenings are an explicit, lossless set (`types::is_promotable`). Implemented on the SQLite single-catalog and PostgreSQL multi-catalog write paths; the PostgreSQL path also bumps `schema_version` + records a `ducklake_schema_versions` row on the promote.

### Changed
- **A column type change on a data write (`Replace`/`Append`) is now rejected** with a clear error pointing at `promote_column_type` — previously a type change on `Replace` was silently dropped (the catalog kept the old type, corrupting reads) and a widening `Append` was silently accepted. Schema evolution must be explicit, mirroring upstream DuckLake's `ALTER`-vs-`INSERT` separation. An alias-only restatement (`bigint` ≡ `int64`) remains a no-op. To adopt a widened source schema, call `promote_column_type` then write under the new type.
- `ducklake_column` no longer uses a single-row `column_id` primary key, so a column can be versioned (two rows sharing a `column_id`): the SQLite layout matches upstream's bare table (invariants enforced in the writer + tests), the PostgreSQL multi-catalog layout uses a composite PK + a partial unique index. Catalogs written by an earlier version are migrated in place on open (idempotent, lossless).

### Fixed
- **Concurrent `WriteMode::Replace` on the experimental PostgreSQL multi-catalog write path could union conflicting generations instead of rejecting one.** Converged the multi-catalog writer onto DuckLake's commit-time model: a snapshot's id is assigned at commit (commit-ordered), and all of its metadata — snapshot, schema/table, columns, data files, and the published head — is written in a single transaction, so committed-but-unpublished rows are never visible to readers or conflict checks. `Replace` now aborts with a `Conflict` error when another writer published a newer generation of the table since the write began. Column field-ids stay stable across a same-schema `Replace`, and an `Append` racing a table creation aborts rather than producing NULL-filled reads. No on-disk format, DuckLake spec, or public API change (#146).
- **Nested (`List` / struct / map) columns could read back all-NULL.** The read-schema field-id matcher built its `field_id → column` map from Parquet *leaf* columns, but a column's field-id is stamped on its *top-level* field — which for a nested column is the group node, leaving the leaf with no id. The column was therefore treated as absent from the file and null-filled. Field-ids are now read from the top-level fields, so nested columns resolve correctly; scalar columns are unaffected (their top-level field is the leaf). Adds a `List` write→read roundtrip regression test.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-23

### Documentation
- Refresh the README, add `COMPATIBILITY.md` documenting the backend/feature matrix, and correct `CLAUDE.md` to reflect read **and** write support. Update the crate-level doc comment accordingly (#144).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **PostgreSQL multi-catalog support.** Manage and read multiple independent DuckLake catalogs within a single PostgreSQL metadata store, including per-catalog data-file segregation on disk, single-table tombstone drops (`drop_table_in_catalog`), and `row_id_start` projection on reads / population on data-file registration (#117, #120, #121, #124, #132).
- **Row lineage.** `rowid` virtual column exposing DuckLake row IDs, opt-in via `DuckLakeCatalog::with_row_lineage(true)`. Compatible with files produced by DuckDB's `UPDATE` / compaction (#115).
- **Maintenance API.** Single-catalog `DROP TABLE`, `expire_snapshots`, and `cleanup_old_files` for reclaiming superseded data, plus `delete_orphaned_files` for storage-scan reclamation of untracked files (#122, #123).
- **Writer tuning.** Configurable Parquet compression (`DuckLakeTableWriter::with_compression`) and row-group caps by row count and byte size (`with_max_row_group_rows` / `with_max_row_group_bytes`) (#126, #128).
- `MetadataProvider::get_table_row_count()`, which accounts for delete files (#131).

### Changed
- Writer streams table writes through a staging file with multipart upload instead of buffering in memory, reducing peak memory for large writes (#127).
- CI: gate the single-catalog backend test suite and fix/quarantine drifted fixtures (#139); run on `ubuntu-latest` instead of `ubuntu-latest-m` (#118).

### Fixed
- Correct reads across schema evolution and repeated writes, resolving per-file schema mapping for schema-evolving reads (#140, #141).
- Make `WriteMode::Replace` atomic to close a transient empty-read window, for both the single-catalog SQLite path and the general path (#135, #138).
- Truncate the table on a zero-row `INSERT OVERWRITE` / Replace (#142).
- Require single-partition input in `DuckLakeInsertExec` (#137).
- Derive `rowid` and delete positions from physical file position (#129).
- Map nanosecond timezone-aware timestamps to `timestamptz_ns` (#133).
- Emit catalog list type for `ARRAY`-backed columns (#125).
- Align `ducklake_column` / `ducklake_data_file` schema with the DuckLake spec (#116).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Implement `TableProvider::statistics()` on `DuckLakeTable`, populating `total_byte_size` from per-file metadata cached on the table (#112). Mirrors DuckLake's `ducklake_table_info` aggregate exactly. Marked `Precision::Inexact` since the catalog tracks compressed parquet bytes while DataFusion documents `total_byte_size` as uncompressed Arrow output. Enables cost-based optimisation hints and provides a cheap surface for size-aware consumers (e.g. pre-flight ingest guards).
